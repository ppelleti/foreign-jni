synopsis: A binding to the Java Native Interface (JNI)
description:
  .
  Haskell bindings to the Java Native Interface. Ideal for writing
  Java native methods in Haskell.
  .
  If the JNI C header files are not in your C compiler's include path,
  you should export $JAVA_HOME before running cabal install or
  configure.
  .
  If you use functions in Foreign.JNI.Lookup you must first call
  either hs_set_java_vm from C (probably in JNI_OnLoad) or setJavaVM
  from Haskell.
